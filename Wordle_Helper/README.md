What is Wordle?
===============
Firstly, you can find the game itself and its own description .  Or, if you don't want to leave this page,

> Guess the WORDLE in 6 tries.
>
> Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.
>
> After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

Why I did this
==============
Have trouble thinking of valid words when doing your Wordle?  Me to.  So I created this algorithm to help people like us more able to play the game, while not completely spoiling the fun (Hey, sometimes it's wrong!).
