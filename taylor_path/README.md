# Taylor's Path

This code is meant to visualize and animate the "path" created by Taylor (or rather the McLaurin) series of a given function at a point _z_.  The idea is that there exists a two-dimensional vector formed by the real and imaginary parts of each term in the series, and if these vectors are attached end to end, they create a path in the complex plane the Taylor series traces out converging to _z_.
