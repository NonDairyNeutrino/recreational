# recreational projects

This is a collection of smaller projects that I just kind of felt like doing.  There are a few algorithms I have developed as answers to
questions on the [https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/](Mathematica StackExchange), a few more just little functions like mocking_spongebob
that converts each letter is a given text randomly to upper- or lowercase, and some others.  I hope you enjoy.
