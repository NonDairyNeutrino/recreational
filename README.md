# StackExchange_Answers
The code related to the answers I have contributed on the Mathematica StackExchange.

This collection of code is the distillation of my answers on the [_Mathematica_ StackExchange](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/) (username: NonDairyNeutrino) to substantial algorithms.
Thus these snippets do not include answers answering basic or too specific questions.

A lot of these answers are by far not the best solutions to the questions asked, but are left because they may be of some use to someone with a similar problem.
